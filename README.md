This is the airnb clone app.
In this project, I'm using full-stack MERN (mongodb and express and node as backend server and react and tailwind for frontend).

In this app, you can create your booking service and U can also do booking too.
for user purpose , U just need to register and login for random email instead.

I'm learning full-stack mern for over 6months now and i'm applying every knowledge I have and combined with yt project.
